# ERC-7484: Registry Extension for ERC-7579

A standard for a registry extensions to support the [ERC-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579) standard. The registry extension allows a modular smart account to get security guarantees about the modules it is about to install or use. This standard outlines the interface for a registry extension that can be used to query the registry for attestations about modules. It also includes a standard way to implement a registry adapter on the account.
