# Overview

The Module SDK is a TypeScript library for using Smart Account Modules in Applications. It allows you to easily install and uninstall modules for any [ERC-7579](https://erc7579.com/) account, interact with and use modules using dedicated helper utilites and can be used alongside existing account SDKs such as [permissionless.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/permissionless), [Biconomy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@biconomy/account), [ZeroDev](https://docs.zerodev.app) and many more.

The Module SDK is split into two components:

- **Accounts** - Account-related helpers, like installing and uninstalling modules
- **Modules** - Integrated modules with helpers for their installation and usage
