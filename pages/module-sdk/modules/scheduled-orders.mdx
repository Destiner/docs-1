# Scheduled Orders

The Scheduled Orders module allows users to schedule swaps to be executed at a later time, with an optional recurring schedule. This is useful for scheduling recurring swap-based executions, such as dollar cost averaging. This module is an executor that is installed on an account and can be triggered by an automation service at the pre-specified time(s).

You can find the source code for the module in the [ModuleKit examples](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/modulekit/blob/main/examples/src/ScheduledTransactions/ScheduledOrders.sol) and the deployment address in the [address book](../../overview/address-book.mdx).

## `RecurringOrder` type

The `RecurringOrder` type is an object that represents a recurring order. It has the following properties:

```typescript
type RecurringOrder = Order & Schedule;

type Order = {
  buyToken: ERC20Token;
  sellToken: ERC20Token;
  amount: number;
  orderType: "buy" | "sell";
  priceLimit?: string;
  maxGasPrice?: string;
  expirationDate?: string;
};

type Schedule = {
  startDate: string;
  repeatEvery: number;
  repeatType: "day" | "week" | "month" | "year";
  numberOfRepeats: number;
};

type ERC20Token = {
  token_address: Address;
  decimals: number;
};
```

## `getSwapOrderData`

The `getSwapOrderData` function is used to create a hex-encoded struct that represents the swap.

```typescript
import { getSwapOrderData } from "@rhinestone/module-sdk";

const swapOrderData = getSwapOrderData({
  recurringOrder: {
    buyToken: {
      token_address: "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48", // USDC
      decimals: 6,
    },
    sellToken: {
      token_address: "0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984", // UNI
      decimals: 18,
    },
    amount: 10,
    orderType: "buy",
    startDate: "1710759572",
    repeatEvery: 1,
    repeatType: "day",
    numberOfRepeats: 10,
  },
});
```

## `getScheduledOrdersExecutor`

The `getScheduledOrdersExecutor` function is used to create an instance of the Scheduled Orders module. The `executionInterval` is a number that designates the interval at which the execution should occur in seconds. The `numberOfExecutions` is a number that designates how many times this transfer should be executed. The `startDate` is the UNIX timestamp of when the first execution should occur. The `executionData` object is a hex-encoded struct that represents the swap (to encode it, use `getSwapOrderData`). This function returns a module object.

```typescript
import { getScheduledOrdersExecutor, getSwapOrderData } from "@rhinestone/module-sdk";

const executionInterval = 60 * 60 * 24; // 1 day
const numberOfExecutions = 10;
const startDate = 1710759572; // UNIX timestamp
const swapOrderData = getSwapOrderData({...});

const scheduledOrderExecutor = getScheduledOrdersExecutor({
  executionInterval,
  numberOfExecutions,
  startDate,
  swapOrderData,
});
```

## `getCreateRecurringOrderExecution`

The `getCreateRecurringOrderExecution` function is used to create an execution that can be used to schedule a swap. The `recurringOrder` is an object of type `RecurringOrder` which includes the details for the scheduled swap. This function returns an execution object.

```typescript
import { getCreateRecurringOrderExecution } from "@rhinestone/module-sdk";

const recurringOrderExecution = getCreateRecurringOrderExecution({
  recurringOrder: {
    ...
  },
});
```

## `SCHEDULED_ORDERS_EXECUTER_ADDRESS`

The `SCHEDULED_ORDERS_EXECUTER_ADDRESS` is a constant that represents the address of the Scheduled Orders module.
