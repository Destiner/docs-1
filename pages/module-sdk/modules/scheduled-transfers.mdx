# Scheduled Transfers

The Scheduled Transfers module allows users to schedule token transfers to occur at a future time, with an optional recurring schedule. It is an executor that is installed on an account and can be triggered by an automation service at the pre-specified time(s).

You can find the source code for the module in the [ModuleKit examples](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/modulekit/blob/main/examples/src/ScheduledTransactions/ScheduledTransfers.sol) and the deployment address in the [address book](../../overview/address-book.mdx).

## `ScheduledTransaction` type

The `ScheduledTransaction` type is an object that represents a scheduled transaction. It has the following properties:

```typescript
type Schedule = {
  startDate: string;
  repeatEvery: number;
  repeatType: "day" | "week" | "month" | "year";
  numberOfRepeats: number;
};

type ERC20Token = {
  name: string;
  symbol: string;
  token_address: string;
  decimals: number;
  chainId: number;
  balance?: string;
  logoURI?: string;
};

type ScheduledTransaction = Schedule & {
  token: ERC20Token;
  amount: number;
  recipient: string;
  maxGasPrice?: number;
};
```

## `getScheduledTransactionData`

The `getScheduledTransactionData` function is used to create a hex-encoded struct that represents the scheduled transaction.

```typescript
import { getScheduledTransactionData } from "@rhinestone/module-sdk";

const isNativeToken = true;
const scheduledTransaction = {
  startDate: "1710759572",
  repeatEvery: 1,
  repeatType: "day",
  numberOfRepeats: 10,
  token: {
    name: "USD Coin",
    symbol: "USDC",
    token_address: "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
    decimals: 6,
    chainId: 1,
  },
  amount: 10,
  recipient: "0x5678...",
};

const scheduledTransactionData = getScheduledTransactionData({
  isNativeToken,
  scheduledTransaction,
});
```

## `getScheduledTransfersExecutor`

The `getScheduledTransfersExecutor` function is used to create an instance of the Scheduled Transfers module. The `executionInterval` is a number that designates the interval at which the execution should occur in seconds. The `numberOfExecutions` is a number that designates how many times this transfer should be executed. The `startDate` is the UNIX timestamp of when the first execution should occur. The `executionData` object is a hex-encoded struct of type [`Action`](../build/accounts#action-object) that represents the transfer. If it is a native token transfer, the `value` should be used, otherwise the `callData` should be an ERC-20 transfer. This function returns a module object.

```typescript
import {
  getScheduledTransfersExecutor,
  getScheduledTransactionData,
} from "@rhinestone/module-sdk";

const executionInterval = 60 * 60 * 24; // 1 day
const numberOfExecutions = 10;
const startDate = 1710759572; // UNIX timestamp
const executionData = getScheduledTransactionData({...});

const scheduledTransfersExecutor = getScheduledTransfersExecutor({
  executionInterval,
  numberOfExecutions,
  startDate,
  executionData,
});
```

## `getCreateScheduledTransferAction`

The `getCreateScheduledTransferAction` function is used to create an action that can be used to schedule a transfer. The `isNativeToken` argument is a boolean flag for whether a token is native or not. The `scheduledTransaction` is an object of type `ScheduledTransaction` which includes the details for the scheduled transfer. This function returns an action object.

```typescript
import { getCreateScheduledTransferAction } from "@rhinestone/module-sdk";

const isNativeToken = true;
const scheduledTransaction = {
  startDate: "1710759572",
  repeatEvery: 1,
  repeatType: "day",
  numberOfRepeats: 10,
  token: {
    name: "USD Coin",
    symbol: "USDC",
    token_address: "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
    decimals: 6,
    chainId: 1,
  },
  amount: 10,
  recipient: "0x5678...",
};

const scheduledTransferAction = getCreateScheduledTransferAction({
  isNativeToken,
  scheduledTransaction,
});
```

## `SCHEDULED_TRANSFERS_EXECUTER_ADDRESS`

The `SCHEDULED_TRANSFERS_EXECUTER_ADDRESS` is a constant that represents the module address.
