# Frontend applications

The main goal of the Sandbox is to make it easy to build frontend applications that are powered by onchain modules. This page gives an overview of the different ways to build frontend applications using the Sandbox.

## Components

The Sandbox comes with a set of pre-built components which can be found in the [UI Kit](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sandbox/tree/main/src/ui-kit). These components are designed to be re-usable and can be used to build your frontend applications.

## Dashboard

To build a frontend application directly into the dashboard, you can insert the components into the [`AccountPage`](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sandbox/blob/main/src/domains/Account/features/AccountPage.tsx). If you want to separate components, you can use the [`components` folder](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/sandbox/tree/main/src/domains/Account/components) and re-use any existing components in there.
