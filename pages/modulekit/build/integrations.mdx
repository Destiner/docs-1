# Integrations

Integrations are Solidity libraries that can easily be integrated into modules to simplify the developer experience for common use cases. The ModuleKit currently has integrations for:

- Yearn
- ERC-4626 Vaults
- ChainLink
- Uniswap

... and more to come! View all integrations [here](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/modulekit/blob/main/src/modulekit/integrations).

To use an integration, simply import it into your module and call the functions that you need.

```solidity
...
import {YearnWithdraw} from "modulekit/modulekit/integrations/yearn/YearnWidthdraw.sol";

contract YearnModule is ExecutorBase {
    ...

    function withdrawFromYearn(IExecutorManager manager, address account, address yToken) external {
        ...
        YearnWithdraw.withdraw(manager, account, yToken);
    }

    ...
}
```
